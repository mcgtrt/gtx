# Web App Stack (Go, Templ, TailwindCSS, HTMX), all back-end generated.

This project is a simple example of how to use the GTX stack. It includes:

- TailwindCSS config that can be launched with `make css`

- Air config file that once installed can be run from the terminal with `air`

- Templ config with proxy watch rebuilder that can be run with `make templ`

Having all those three launched provides with all-in development environment to create production-ready web apps, sites, and services.
